The icons in this directory (*.svg and *.png) are based on the Blender

The Blender icons themselves are normally part of a single large SVG
file, but we made use of the version provided at
https://github.com/Shrinks99/blender-icons
and we thank Henry Wilkinson for the hard work of separating all the
icons into individual files that are much simpler to work with.
